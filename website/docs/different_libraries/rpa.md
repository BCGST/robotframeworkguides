## Introduction

[RPA Framework](https://rpaframework.org/) is a collection of open-source libraries and tools for
Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and it is designed to be used with both
[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org) and [Python](https://python.org/). The goal is to offer well-documented and
actively maintained core libraries for Software Robot Developers.
