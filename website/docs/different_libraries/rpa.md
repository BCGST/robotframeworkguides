First of all please do not forget that the libraries in RPA can be used for test automation and vice-versa.
The list here is just to give a few recommendations on where to start.


### Rpaframework

[Rpaframework](https://rpaframework.org) has been implemented and collected to just simplify the most common RPA use cases. The library is a collection of libraries which makes the dependency management a lot simpler.
The library contains libraries for most common automation targets: HTTP API, browser, Windows Desktop, Excel, PDF, Email, Database, Notifiers, Slack,...

### ...more coming..
