We will use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python.

Install homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Follow instructions to add brew to path
(Those are shown after homebrew installation)

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> $HOME/.profile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Install pyenv

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

Add pyenv to Path

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Add Python Build Dependencies
```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk
```
Install a Python 3.10.6

```bash
pyenv install 3.10.6
```

Tell pyenv to use Python 3.10.6 globally

```bash	
pyenv global 3.10.6
python --version
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see something like this:

```
Python 3.10.6
```

<summary>Assumptions and other notes</summary>  

:::note python, python3, pip, pip3
We assume that Python3 and pip are installed.  
We use the commands `pip` and `python` to install packages or run Python scripts.  
Depending on your setup, those commands may be `pip3` and `python3` or `pip` and `python`.
:::

:::note Terminal, Bash and cmd
When we mention the word `terminal`, we mean both - a linux terminal (e.g. `bash`) or a windows command line (`cmd`).
:::

:::note Install globally vs. virtual environments
Python allows you to install modules via `pip`.  
By default, those modules are installed in the global Python environment.

But especially when working on multiple projects, it is more convenient to have a separate Python environment for each project with all the required packages installed (like `robotframework` or additional libraries like `robotframework-seleniumlibrary`).  
To separate the global Python environment from the project environment, you can use a `virtual environment`.  
We will cover both approaches in the following chapters.
:::

:::note Show info about installed packages
You can type `pip show robotframework` to get more information about the installed version of Robot Framework and the install location.
:::

</details>

### Install Robot Framework globally
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Install Robot Framework globally" label="Global" default>

 Open your `terminal`

```cmd
pip install robotframework
robot --version
``` 

![Install Robot Framework](/img/getting_started/installrfwin.gif)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see something like

```bash
Robot Framework 5.x.y (Python 3.x.y)
```
### Install Robot Framework in a Virtual Environment

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

We recommend to have a folder on your drive to store your projects, e.g. `C:\projects`.  
Open your `terminal`

```cmd
cd C:\projects
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install robotframework
robot --version
```
You should see something like

```cmd
Robot Framework 5.x.y (Python 3.x.y)
```

You can type `pip show robotframework` to get more information about the installed version of Robot Framework and the install location.  
The virtual environment can be deactivated by typing `venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat`.

If you prefer to use `PowerShell` instead of `cmd`, you can use the following commands for activating and deactivating the virtual environment:  

- Activate: `venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
- Deactivate: `venv\Scripts\deactivate.ps1`  

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

We recommend to have a folder on your drive to store your projects, e.g. `~/projects`.  
Open your `terminal`

```cmd
cd ~/projects
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install robotframework
robot --version
```
You should see something like

```cmd
Robot Framework 5.x.y (Python 3.x.y)
```

The virtual environment can be deactivated by typing `source .venv/bin/deactivate`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="MacOS" label="MacOS" default>
We recommend to have a folder on your drive to store your projects, e.g. `~/projects`.  
Open your `terminal`

```cmd
cd ~/projects
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
```

Tell pyenv to use Python 3.10.6 (if you haven't done so already).  
Either globally
```bash
pyenv global 3.10.6
```

Or locally (for the current folder only)

```bash
pyenv local 3.10.6
```

Create and activate a new Virtual Environment and install robotframework

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install robotframework
robot --version
```
You should see something like

```cmd
Robot Framework 5.x.y (Python 3.x.y)
```

The virtual environment can be deactivated by typing `source .venv/bin/deactivate`.

## Other Recommendations

### Managing Dependencies with poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.  
You can use it when you start any new project **python** or **robotframework** project.

Install poetry by following the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

Open PowerShell and run the following command:

```cmd
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

ðŸ’¡If you have installed Python through the Microsoft Store, replace `py` with `python` in the command above.
  
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```	

ðŸ’¡On some systems, `python` may still refer to Python 2 instead of Python 3. So we used `python3` in the command above. 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MacOS" label="MacOS" default>

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```	

ðŸ’¡On some systems, `python` may still refer to Python 2 instead of Python 3. So we used `python3` in the command above.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Run poetry once to check if it's installed.

```shell
poetry --version
```


#### Virtual Environments folder

Poetry will save the virtual enviromentson in the `.poetry/envs` folder. You can change that setting and store your virtual environment in the project folder by running
   
```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

#### Initialize a new project

To initialize a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
poetry init
```

Poetry will ask you some questions about your project. You can leave the default values by pressing `Enter` or enter your own values.

Example:
  
```shell
This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Package name [your-project-name]:
Version [0.1.0]:
Description []:
Author [Your Name <your.email@example.com>, n to skip]:
License []:
Compatible Python versions [^3.10]:

Would you like to define your main dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] no
Would you like to define your development dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] no
```

After the initialization, you will see a new file called `pyproject.toml` in your project folder. This file contains all the information about your project and the dependencies.

#### Add dependencies

To add a dependency, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
poetry add robotframework
```

You can also add multiple dependencies at once:

```shell
poetry add robotframework robotframework-browser robotframework-requests
```

On the first run, poetry will create a virtual environment for your project and install the dependencies.

#### Run Commands in the Virtual Environment

To run commands in the virtual environment, you can use the `poetry run` command.

```shell
poetry run robot --version
```

To e.g. install the playwright dependencies for robotframework-browser, you can run the following command:

```shell
poetry run rfbrowser init
```

You can also use the `poetry shell` command to open a shell in the virtual environment.  
All commands you run in this shell will be executed in the virtual environment.

```shell
poetry shell
(.venv) robot --version
```
